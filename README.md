# Advent of Code
A repository to hold my solutions to the :christmas_tree: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) :christmas_tree: Puzzles.
#### General Overview
For those not familiar with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), it is a yearly coding challenge consisting of two problems released each day in the month of December.

This repository is sorted at the top level by year. Each year contains a series of directories corresponding to each day of the challenge. Both challenges for a day will be found in that day's directory.

These solutions represent my general effort to solve the challenges and may therefore employ a variety of different technologies and approaches, but most will use [python](https://www.python.org/).

These will rarely be "optimal" solutions, but I hope that you find them interesting/useful.

#### Details
Each day's directory will contain a readme that explains my approach to solving the corresponding challenge. Further, each year's directory will _also_ contain a readme with more details about my interaction with that year's Advent of Code.
